# Lab 3 (CSCI 360 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)

Lab instruction: [`lab 3.pdf`](lab 3.pdf). Due on Oct 31th, 2025, EOD PT.

**Submission**: Submit your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to Gradescope. Please ensure that your `.ipynb` file including your code and the output from running all cells.

Extra credit instruction: Include your extra credit work in the same Jupyter Notebook file. Note that extra credits **do not** overflow, meaning a final score >100pts will be treated as 100pts. Check [`lab 3.pdf`](lab 3.pdf) for details on extra credits grading.


## Writing Your Code

You can use any Python package that is installed by `pip` or `conda` when you create the environment.

For clarity in your work, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to organize your work. Use clear Markdown sections to indicate questions, code and results. A template is provided for `.ipynb` file: [lab3.ipynb](lab3.ipynb). Feel free to do your work in this template. 

**Important**: Ensure your submitted `.ipynb` file includes both code and output from all executed cells, or points will be deducted.


## How we will grade

### Main part (max 100 pts; problem 1)

- General soundness of your code (60 pts): Your code should include all required steps with clear comments. Points will be deducted if your implementation is incomplete or missing required steps.
- plot and reported values (40 pts): Your program should output correct numerical results and figures.

### Extra credit (max 20 pts; problem 2)
